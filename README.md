React Project - 1
Static Landing Page (SPA) 

The first part of the course was only just pure React, without any of the Redux or any of the MERN stack. Great introduction though, I might add! 

I deployed the website on Surge: neat-bedroom.surge.sh

Surge is great for front-end deployment but not when it comes to databse server. That one would require other deployments which will be in the 2nd and 3rd part of this course.
